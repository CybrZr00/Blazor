A layout group ([DxFormLayoutGroup](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxFormLayoutGroup)) is a container for layout items ([DxFormLayoutItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxFormLayoutItem)) and other layout groups. Layout groups, just like individual items, allow you to specify their width using the same set of [ColSpanXX](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxFormLayoutGroup._members) properties.

Spline chart series visualize data trends over specified intervals after interpolation. In the example above, you can switch between the following spline series types: 

*   [Spline](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartSplineSeries-3) - displays data as points joined by a spline interpolation. 
*   [Stacked Spline](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartStackedSplineSeries-3) - displays data as points joined by a spline interpolation. Different series do not overlap because their values are stacked. 
*   [Full Stacked Spline](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartFullStackedSplineSeries-3) - displays the percentage value of multiple spline series for each argument.

Group summaries are calculated across all rows within a group and displayed in the group row. To create group summaries, add [DxGridSummaryItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem) objects to the [GroupSummary](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.GroupSummary) collection.  

You can use the following DxGridSummaryItem properties: 

* [SummaryType](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem.SummaryType) – Specifies the aggregate function (Sum, Min, Max, Avg, or Count). 
* [FieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem.FieldName) – Specifies the name of the data field whose values are used to calculate the summary. The Min and Max functions support data fields whose values can be compared. The Avg and Sum functions work with numeric fields only. For the Count function, you do not need to set this property. 
* [ValueDisplayFormat](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem.ValueDisplayFormat) – Specifies the pattern used to format the summary value. If you do not define this property, the summary applies the format from the column bound to the same data field ([FieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem.FieldName)). The Grid supports standard formats. For more information, see the following help topic: [Format types in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/formatting-types).

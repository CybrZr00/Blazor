Our Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid) component allows you to display, manage, and manipulate tabular data with ease. Use the [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) property to bind the DevExpresss Blazor Grid to data. In this demo, the Blazor Grid is bound to a data collection that is loaded synchronously. To display data within the Blazor Grid, add [DxGridColumn](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridColumn) objects to the [Columns](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Columns) collection and use each objectâ€™s [FieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridColumn.FieldName) property to assign data fields.

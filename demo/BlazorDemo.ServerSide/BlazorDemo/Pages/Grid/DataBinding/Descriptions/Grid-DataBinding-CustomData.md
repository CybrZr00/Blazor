You can use our Blazor [GridDevExtremeDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) to bind the Blazor Grid to data from an HTTP service. Our data source implementation is based on the [DevExtreme.AspNet.Data](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data) library. When you use this data source, the DevExpress Blazor Grid only loads data that needs to be displayed on screen. This helps improve overall performance and application responsiveness. 

To replicate this sample, create a [GridDevExtremeDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) class instance and pass a URL to an HTTP service as the constructor parameter. Then, assign this instance to the Grid's [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) property. On the service side, [implement an API controller](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/401020/devextreme-based-controls/concepts/bind-controls-to-data/api-controllers) and create action methods that use the [DataSourceLoader](https://devexpress.github.io/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/net/api/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data.DataSourceLoader.html) class to create a [LoadResult](https://devexpress.github.io/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/net/api/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data.ResponseModel.LoadResult.html) object based on load options. 

In this demo, the ASP.NET Controller uses Entity Framework Core and delegates data processing operations to the database server. As mentioned previously, this improves the Blazor Gridâ€™s performance and overall responsiveness.

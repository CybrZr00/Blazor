You can use our Blazor [GridDevExtremeDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) to bind the Grid to data from an HTTP service. The data source implementation is based on the [DevExtreme.AspNet.Data](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data) library. When you use this data source, the Grid loads only data that should be displayed on screen. 

Create a [GridDevExtremeDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) class instance and pass a URL to an HTTP service as the constructor parameter. Then, assign this instance to the Grid's [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) property. On the service side, [implement an API controller](http://docs.devexpress.devx/AspNetCore/401020/devextreme-based-controls/concepts/bind-controls-to-data/api-controllers) and create action methods that use the [DataSourceLoader](https://devexpress.github.io/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/net/api/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data.DataSourceLoader.html) class to create a [LoadResult](https://devexpress.github.io/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/net/api/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data.ResponseModel.LoadResult.html) object based on load options. 

In this demo, an ASP.NET Controller uses Entity Framework Core and delegates data processing operations to the database server. This improves the Gridâ€™s responsiveness and performance.

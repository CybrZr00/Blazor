In this mode, the DevExpress [TreeView](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeView) component loads a node’s children when the node is expanded for the first time. This mode allows you to improve the TreeView’s performance for tree structures with a large number of nodes.

You can use the "**Load Child Nodes on Demand**" for bound and unbound TreeView nodes.

The following API members are related to this mode:

*   [LoadChildNodesOnDemand](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeView.LoadChildNodesOnDemand) - Specifies whether child nodes are loaded on demand.
*   [HasChildrenExpression](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeView.HasChildrenExpression) - A lambda expression that specifies whether the data item has child items.

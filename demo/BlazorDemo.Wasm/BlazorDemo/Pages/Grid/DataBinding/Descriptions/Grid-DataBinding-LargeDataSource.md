Our Blazor [GridDevExtremeDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) allows you to improve performance when binding to large [IQueryable\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.iqueryable-1) data collections. The data source implementation is based on the [DevExtreme.AspNet.Data](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data) library. When you use this data source, the Grid loads only data that should be displayed on screen, and data processing operations are delegated to the database server. 

Create a [GridDevExtremeDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) class instance and pass your [IQueryable\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.iqueryable-1) data collection as the constructor parameter. Then, assign this instance to the Grid's [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) property.  

In this demo, the grid is bound to a data collection with over a million rows (1GB+ in overall size). Navigate between grid pages or sort data to experience the Grid's responsiveness and performance capabilities.

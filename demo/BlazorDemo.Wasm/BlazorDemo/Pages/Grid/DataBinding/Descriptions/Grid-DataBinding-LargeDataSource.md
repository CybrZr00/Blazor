Our Blazor [GridDevExtremeDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) allows you to improve performance when binding to large [IQueryable\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.iqueryable-1) data collections. The data source implementation is based on the DevExpress [DevExtreme.AspNet.Data](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data) library. When you use this data source, the Grid only loads the data needed for screen display and it delegates data processing operations to the database server.

To replicate this demo, create a [GridDevExtremeDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) class instance and pass your [IQueryable\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.iqueryable-1) data collection as the constructor parameter. Then, assign this instance to the Blazor Grid's [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) property.  In this demo, the grid is bound to a data collection with over a million rows (1GB+ in overall size). Navigate between individual Grid pages or sort data to explore our Blazor Grid's performance capabilities and its overall responsiveness.

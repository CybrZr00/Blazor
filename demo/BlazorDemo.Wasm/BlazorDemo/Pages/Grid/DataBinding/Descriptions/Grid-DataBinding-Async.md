In this demo, our Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid) is bound to a data collection that is loaded asynchronously. To do this, bind the [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) property to a model field and initialize this field with data in the [OnInitializeAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/lifecycle#component-initialization-oninitializedasync) lifecycle method.

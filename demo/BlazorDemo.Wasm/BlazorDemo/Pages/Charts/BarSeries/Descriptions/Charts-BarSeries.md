Bar series are used to display values in different discrete categories such as months, countries, age, etc. In this example, you can switch between the [Bar](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartBarSeries-3), [Stacked Bar](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartStackedBarSeries-3), and [Full Stacked Bar](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartFullStackedBarSeries-3) series types. Stacked Bar series are used when you need to display several series that represent values for discrete categories. The Full Stacked Bar series show the value percentage of several bar series for each argument.

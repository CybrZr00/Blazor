Line chart series visualize data trends over specified intervals. In this example, you can switch between the following line series types: 

*   [Line](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartLineSeries-3) - displays data as points joined by line segments. 
*   [Stacked Line](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartStackedLineSeries-3) - visualizes multiple series and shows each seriesâ€™ contribution to the total aggregate value for specific arguments. 
*   [Full Stacked Line](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartFullStackedLineSeries-3) - displays the percentage value of multiple line series for each argument.

In the following example, polynomial curves limit the area. You can choose between the following spline area series types:  

*   [Spline Area](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartSplineAreaSeries-3) - displays data as a spline interpolation of the series values. 
*   [Stacked Spline Area](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartStackedSplineAreaSeries-3) - displays data as a spline interpolation of the series values. Different series do not overlap because their values are stacked.  
*   [Full Stacked Spline Area](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartFullStackedSplineAreaSeries-3) - displays the percentage value of multiple spline area series for each argument.

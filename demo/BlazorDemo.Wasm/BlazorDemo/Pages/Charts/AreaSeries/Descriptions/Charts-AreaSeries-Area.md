Area series can be used to emphasize value changes. In this example, you can switch between the following area series types: 

*   [Area](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartAreaSeries-3) - displays data as a region between the data curve and the argument axis. 
*   [Stacked Area](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartStackedAreaSeries-3) - visualizes multiple series and allows users to determine how a series constitutes the total aggregate value for specific arguments. 
*   [Full Stacked Area](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartFullStackedAreaSeries-3) -â€¯displays the percentage value of multiple area series for each argument.

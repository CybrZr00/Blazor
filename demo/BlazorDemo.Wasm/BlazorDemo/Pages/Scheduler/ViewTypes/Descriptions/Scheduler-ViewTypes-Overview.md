The DevExpress [Scheduler](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler) for Blazor can display appointments in a Timeline, Day, Work Week, Week, or Month View. This demo illustrates how to use and customize these views:


*   Week View ([DxSchedulerWeekView](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSchedulerWeekView)) - Displays appointments for all the days in a specified week.
*   Work Week View ([DxSchedulerWorkWeekView](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSchedulerWorkWeekView)) - Displays appointments for work days in a week.
*   Day View ([DxSchedulerDayView](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSchedulerDayView)) - Displays appointments for specified days.
*   Month View ([DxSchedulerMonthView](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSchedulerMonthView)) - Displays appointments by month.
*   Timeline View ([DxSchedulerTimelineView](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSchedulerTimelineView)) - Displays appointments as horizontal bars along timescales.

You can use the [ActiveViewType](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.ActiveViewType) property to specify the initial view, and the View Selector to switch between views.

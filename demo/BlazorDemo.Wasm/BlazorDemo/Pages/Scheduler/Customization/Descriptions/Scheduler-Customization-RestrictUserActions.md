You can prevent users from creating, updating, and deleting appointments. To do this, set the [AllowCreateAppointment](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.AllowCreateAppointment), [AllowEditAppointment](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.AllowEditAppointment), and [AllowDeleteAppointment](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.AllowDeleteAppointment) properties to `false`.
